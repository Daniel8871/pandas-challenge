All four of the five top spenders ('Lisosia93', 'Idastidru52', 'Chamjask73', 'Iral74', and 'Iskadarya95') were within the top age demographic of 20-24 year olds with the single outlier barely outside, at age 25. Similarly, four of these top spenders were also part of the largest gender demographic (male). As a result of this information, it would service the Heroes of Pymoli marketing to focus on the 20-24 year old male demographic when developing methods to bring in new gamers.

These top five spenders among the gamers demonstrated a willingness to pay for the high price items (>$4.00), but interestingly, only two of the top five grossing items were purchased by the top five spending gamers. This demonstrates that the item-development team has a robust selection of tools available for purchase. These designers have essentially doubled the item-purchase profit opportunities by catering to lower spending gamers with the top five Items, and to the highest spending gamers with a separate set of items.

Lastly, an interesting trend in the Age Summary data shows the prime age demographic (20-24years) were among the most willing to spend per purchase ($4.32), however the top two demographics for spending were the children (<10years) and those of traditional parenting age (35-40years). This indicates that parents may enjoy playing together, and that parents are willing to buy Items for both themself and their child.
